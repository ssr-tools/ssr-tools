# @ssr-tools

üöß **The library is in early stage of the development, therefore is not recommended to use it on production** üöß

`@ssr-tools` is a set of simple modules for a server-side rendered application development with React.

That‚Äôs an alternative approach to the React based frameworks, that often happen to be very limiting. With `@ssr-tools` you can compose the app from the modules that it really needs, no more no less.

[See documentation for the user of the library https://ssr-tools.notion.site/ssr-tools-documentation-ccb835a0f49941f99c19cc3732e47b66.](https://ssr-tools.notion.site/ssr-tools-documentation-ccb835a0f49941f99c19cc3732e47b66) 


# Development

Below you can find a guidance for the `@ssr-tools` maintainers.

## Getting started

Before you start, you‚Äôll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and access to the terminal on your machine.

Open up the terminal and follow the instructions:

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:ssr-tools/ssr-tools.git`
2. Install shared dependencies `npm i`
3. You may also have to run `npm i` in the scope of a [workspace](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) that‚Äôd like to work on. For instance, if you‚Äôd like to work on a `@ssr-tools/css`, first you have to run `npm i -w lib/css`.
4. To test your work during the development, you either need to: 
    1. create some test cases and run: `npm run test` or `npm run test:e2e`, or
    2. use some example project to ‚Äúclick around‚Äù. To do that, you have to start the development server of the example project e.g.: `npm run dev -w examples/with-fastify` and open up the browser using the development server‚Äôs address e.g.: `http://localhost:3000` .

## Project structure

`@ssr-tools` takes an advantage of [the monorepo approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) and [npm workspaces.](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) The project does not have a single entry point by design.

### `/`

Besides subdirectories, it also consists of the configuration files.

### `/lib`

It consists of the directories that maps to the packages available to install:

- `/lib/css` ‚Üí `npm i @ssr-tools/css`
- `/lib/async-data-store` ‚Üí `npm i @ssr-tools/async-data-store`
- `/lib/eslint-config-ssr-tools` ‚Üí `npm i eslint-config-ssr-tools` (this one is not under `@ssr-tools` to follow [the convention of ESLint‚Äôs sharable configs](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs))
- and so on‚Ä¶

Each package in `lib` is an independent project, **they should never depend on each other.**

### `/examples`

It consists of the directories that maps to the example project. You may use them to run E2E tests or just ‚Äúclick around‚Äù.

- `/examples/with-fastify`
- and so on‚Ä¶

### `/scripts`

It consists of the shell scripts that automate repeating tasks such as building the project or publishing it to the npm registry. You can find more info about the particular script by reading comments in its code.

## Never modify history on the remote branches

Once the branch goes to the remote, we should avoid modifying its commit history. We should not rebase the branch, nor amend its commits. Aesthetics are important in the commit messages, but safe and easy merges take the priority. Git encourages having a non-linear history. If that‚Äôs your concern, you might be better off using a version control system that only handles a linear history.

If it happens that you‚Äôd like to amend your last commit and the commit is already on remote, you should add a new commit with the exact message.

## Commit convention

Most of the commits will have a one line description, and it should not be longer than 80 characters. 

The structure of the commit should be the following:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Where:

- **`type`** is one of the following:
    - `build` ‚Äî changes related to the new version's release. Typically, bumped version of the `@ssr-tools` package
    - `chore` ‚Äî changes to the configuration files and scripts, upgrading the vendor packages etc‚Ä¶
    - `docs` ‚Äî documentation only changes
    - `feat` ‚Äî a new feature
    - `fix` ‚Äî a bug fix or performance improvement
    - `refactor` ‚Äî a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - `style` ‚Äî changes that do not impact the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
    - `test` ‚Äî adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **`scope`** ‚Äî can be omitted if a given change is related to all packages. Otherwise, it should be the name of the related package, e.g., `router`
- **`subject`** ‚Äî a brief description of the change. It should give the grasp on what the change is about. We should use the imperative mood here, as we would give an order to the codebase e.g., `Add a hook for handling search parameters`.

Combining it all together, the example commit message would look like this:

```
feat(router): Add a hook for handling search parameters
```

The only exceptions, from the above convention, are merging commits. They are created when one branch is being merged into another branch. The merging commits are typically created via a repository tool such as GitHub and have an automatically generated header, e.g., `Merge pull request #5 from ssr-tools/refactor/router/router-actions`. We treat these commits individually and add a detailed description regarding the changes that a merged branch introduces.

## Branch name & pull request convention

The convention for the branches name is similar to the [commit convention](#commit-convention). However, to make the branch name valid for Git, we have to use a bit different structure for the branch names:

```
<type>/<scope>/<subject>
```

Where type, scope and subject follows the same convention as we have for the commit messages.

A pull request's title on Github should be the same as its branch name.


## Publishing a new version

1. Test your changes and make sure everything works as expected
2. Review the code and refactor it
3. Merge the changes to the `main` branch
4. Update the changelog
5. Bump the version following [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
6. Run `publishPackage` script in the package‚Äôs scope, e.g.: `npm run publishPackage -w lib/css`
7. After the new version has been published, commit the new version, e.g.: `git add . && git commit -m "build(css): 0.0.13" && git push`

## Tests

The tests are powered by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).

### Integration & Unit

To run integration & unit tests use `npm run test`.

These tests are built upon [React Test Utilities](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html). They are located in the `*.test.ts(x)` files inside the `/lib` directory.

### E2E

To run E2E tests use `npm run test:e2e` . 

These tests run in a real browser which is driven by Puppeteer. They are located in `*.e2e.ts` files inside the `/examples` directory. Make sure you did start the development server for the tested example, otherwise you‚Äôll get an error.
